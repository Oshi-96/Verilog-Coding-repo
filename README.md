# Verilog-Coding-repo
Some Verilog codes for combinational and sequential circuits, such as Flip Flops, Counters, Adders, and Substractors are included.

## Combinational Circuits
Output of the circuit only depends on the current input.

## Sequential Circuits
Output of the circuit depends on the current input and the preveious output.
